# Notes for running the CRM application

This file contains a list of all the `php artisan` commands that you need to run to get the application working. Since the development environment is unstable, I have created all the necessary files manually. You will need to run the following commands in the specified order from the `crm` directory.

## 1. Run Database Migrations

After I have created all the migration files, you will need to run the following command to create the necessary tables in your database:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

I will update this file as I create more files and features.
